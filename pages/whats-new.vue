  <h3>Oct 2016 </h3>
  <p>
    We have purchased the AutoPulse® Resuscitation System by Zoll to provide high-quality automated CPR to victims of sudden cardiac
    arrest on the move. This device is NOW available at our First Aid station during medical cover for large scale events.
  </p>
  <p>The Autopulse has improved outcomes in numerous clinical trials. The AutoPulse’s stabilizing board can be placed on a
    soft stretcher, so that high-quality CPR can continue while our paramedics carry the patient to the nearest ambulance for hospital evacuation.
  </p>
